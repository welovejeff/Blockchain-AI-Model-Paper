# Summary
AI generated images are in need of provenance, especially when the sole purpose is for commercial ends.

And in some cases, these images should include attribution of the prompt used to generate the new art and any influences from other artists that weighed heavier in the algorithms response.

This white paper will work to show an approach that promotes the use of the blockchain as an immutable source of provenance, attribution, and ultimately royalty payment for AI generated creative works.

The goal is to show that the best approach for artists whose copy-written works are being used to train AI models is to volunteer their catalog for training, in exchange for compensation and attribution. Weâ€™ll look at how this first could be deployed in generative artwork built for the sole purpose of digital sales, NFTs. Then will will examine how this blockchain based system could be expanded to all AI generated creative via a digital image identification system like the widely industry backed Content Authenticity Initiative.

This approach put forth in this white paper takes on the assumption that a new AI image diffusion model would need to be created with the ability for creators to opt-in and add their artwork to training, and that this model could report out its weight of influence from each of these artists works. And that this model could write its creations to a blockchain with the metadata attached of the prompt used, artists influence weight, and in the case of any generated revenue from a sale, execute a smart contract to payback a royalty to the appropriate artists.

- Introduction to the proposed solution: using blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate and secure payment for AI-trained images

## Background
- Explanation of the challenges of attributing and compensating artists whose works are used in the training of AI models
- Review of newly launched initiatives from companies like Shutterstock to help compensate artists
- A look at pending legal action that could treaten the adoption of AI

## Provenance and Attribution via the Blockchain
- Explanation of how the blockchain can be used as an immutable source of provenance and attribution for AI generated images
- Discussion of how artists can volunteer their catalog for training in exchange for compensation and attribution

## Use Case: Generative Art for Digital Sales
- Explanation of how the proposed solution could be deployed in the context of generative artwork built for digital sales and NFTs

## Expansion to all AI Generated Creative Works
- Discussion of how the blockchain based system could be expanded to all AI generated creative works through the use of a digital image identification system like CAI

## Proposed AI Image Diffusion Model
- Explanation of the new AI image diffusion model that would need to be created to implement the proposed solution
- Discussion of the features and capabilities of the model, including the ability for creators to opt-in and add their artwork to training, reporting of influence weight from each artist's work, and execution of smart contracts for royalty payment.

## Conclusion
- Summary of the key points and a call to action for further research and development in this field
- Discussion of how the proposed solution has the potential to revolutionize the way that artists are attributed and compensated for their contributions in the AI-training process.
