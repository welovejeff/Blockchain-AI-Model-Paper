# Summary
AI generated images are in need of provenance, especially when the sole purpose is for commercial ends.
And in some cases, these images should include attribution to the prompt used to generate the image and any influences from other artists that weighed heavier in the algorithms response.
In this white paper I’ll work to show an approach that promotes the use of the blockchain as an immutable source of provenance, attribution, and ultimately royalty payment for AI generated creative works.
The goal is to show that the best approach for artists whose copy-written works are being used to train AI models is to volunteer their catalog for training, in exchange for compensation and attribution. We’ll look at how this first could be deployed in generative artwork built for the sole purpose of digital sales, NFTs. Then will will examine how this blockchain based system could be expanded to all AI generated creative via a digital image identification system like the widely industry backed Content Authenticity Initiative.
This approach put forth in this white paper takes on the assumption that a new AI image diffusion model would need to be created with the ability for creators to opt-in and add their artwork to training, and that this model could report out its weight of influence from each of these artists works. And that this model could write its creations to a blockchain with the metadata attached of the prompt used, artists influence weight, and in the case of any generated revenue from a sale, execute a smart contract to payback a royalty to the appropriate artists.

Compensating Artists for their Contribution in Training AI: A Blockchain-based Solution for Secure and Automated Payment of image-based modeling

# Introduction
- Overview of the problem of artist compensation in the age of AI and machine learning
- Introduction to the proposed solution: using blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate and secure payment for AI-trained images

## Technical details
- Explanation of how the system would work, including the use of digital tokens and smart contracts
- Discussion of the potential challenges and limitations of the system
- Explanation of how Adobe's Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) can be used to track past images and verify their authenticity.

## Benefits 
- Analysis of the potential benefits of the system, such as increased transparency, automation, and tamper-proofing the process of artist compensation
- Discussion of how using CAI in partnership with blockchain technology can help to ensure that artists are properly compensated for their contributions

## Case studies 
- Examples of how the system could be implemented in different industries, such as video games, virtual reality, and digital art
- Discussion of how the CAI can be used to track past images and ensure that compensation is distributed to the correct artists.

## Conclusion
- Summary of the key points and a call to action for further research and development in this field
- Discussion of how Adobe's Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) has the potential to revolutionize the way that artists are compensated for their contributions in the AI-training process.
