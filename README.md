# Summary
Artificial Intelligence (AI) generated images are in need of provenance, especially when they are intended for commercial use. In some cases, these images should include attribution to the prompt used to generate the art and any influences from other artists that had a significant impact on the algorithm's response.

This white paper aims to demonstrate an approach that promotes the use of blockchain technology as an immutable source of provenance, attribution, and royalty payment for AI generated creative works.

The goal is to demonstrate that the best approach for artists whose copyright protected works are being used to train AI models is to volunteer their catalog for training in exchange for compensation and attribution. We will examine how this could first be deployed in the context of generative artwork created specifically for digital sales and NFTs. Then, we will explore how the blockchain-based system could be expanded to all AI generated creative works through the use of a digital image identification system such as the widely industry-backed Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI).

This approach assumes the creation of a new AI image diffusion model with the capability for creators to opt-in and add their artwork to training. This model could report the weight of influence from each artist's work, and write its creations to a blockchain along with metadata about the prompt used, artists' influence weight, and, in the event of any generated revenue from a sale, execute a smart contract to pay a royalty to the appropriate artists.
